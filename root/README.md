# Grade Calculator

The aim of this project is to help me figure out how well I need to do on test(s)/assignment(s) to get the grade I want. 
Learning project to get better at web development, build a REST API backend with Rust (though unnecessary, but interesting) to perform calculations (all very simple)

## Intended Features

 - support for weights (i.e. exams are 80%, assignments 20%)
 - how will a grade drop/increase affect GPA

### First Feature

 - Input: 
	 - weights,
	 - total acquired points / total possible points or %, based on needs, for each weighted section, 
	 - value of important test /  assignment, 
	 - grade you want,
 - Output:
	 - score necessary to get intended grade

### Possible Future Features:

 - create a sign in system and save grade information to gain experience of adding a DB to this stack
 - support for weighted GPAs
 - support for foreign grading systems
