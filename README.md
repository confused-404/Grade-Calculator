# Grade Calculator

This project helps users determine the score they need on tests or assignments to achieve their desired grade.

## Current Features

- **Calculate Required Final Exam Score**:
  - Based on your current grade.
  - Targeted (intended) grade.
  - Final exam weight.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust using the `axum` crate for handling server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: React for a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Project Goals

This is a straightforward application designed to assist with grade calculations. While the functionality is basic, the project demonstrates the integration of a React frontend with a Rust backend using modern frameworks.

## Future Improvements (on hold)

- Support for additional calculations (e.g., cumulative GPA).
- More customizable grading options.
- Enhanced UI for a better user experience.
