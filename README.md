# Grade Calculator

The aim of this project is to help me figure out how well I need to do on test(s)/assignment(s) to get the grade I want. 
Learning project to get better at web development, build a REST API backend with Rust (though unnecessary, but interesting) to perform calculations (all very simple)

backend: 
	REST API made with Rust and Axum framework

frontend:
	React JS

## Current Features

 - calculate score needed on final exam based on:
	- current grade,
   	- intended grade,
   	- final exam weight,
- backend now hosted using fly.io

## Intended Features

 - support for weights (i.e. exams are 80%, assignments 20%)
 - how will a grade drop/increase affect GPA
 - security (some sort of authorization)

### Possible Future Features:

 - create a sign in system and save grade information to gain experience of adding a DB to this stack
 - support for weighted GPAs
 - support for foreign grading systems
